The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a symmetric key encryption algorithm that uses the same secret key for both encryption and decryption. It operates on 128-bit data blocks through multiple rounds of substitution, permutation, mixing, and key addition. The number of rounds depends on the key size: 10 for 128-bit, 12 for 192-bit, and 14 for 256-bit keys. For MAVLink protocol encryption, we employ AES in Counter (CTR) mode with a 128-bit key and 128-bit block size. CTR mode is selected because it produces ciphertext of the same size as the plaintext, maintaining MAVLink's strict message formatting. AES-CTR offers strong security and efficient performance, making it ideal for real-time UAV communication.
